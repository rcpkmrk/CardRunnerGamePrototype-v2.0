# Card Runner Prototype v.2
-This is a prototype of a game that combines card mechanics with a runner game <br>
-Purpose of this prototype is to experimenting with combining different game mechanics <br>
-Because it is a prototype, there are limited number of cards and enemies added <br>
-In the game, while not touching and dragging a card, time goes slow to give the player to think about the next move and built a effective strategy <br>
-New enemies which are flying, new cards which have features like throwing projectiles, providing shield etc. will be added <br>
-Note: The assets and sounds are obtained from Unity Asset Store (https://assetstore.unity.com/), but the codes and the gameplay ideas are belong to me.
