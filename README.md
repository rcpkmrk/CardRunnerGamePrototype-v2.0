# Card Runner Prototype v.2
-This is a prototype of a game that combines card mechanics with a runner game. <br>
-The purpose of this prototype is to experiment with combining different game mechanics. <br>
-Because it is a prototype, there are a limited number of cards and enemies added, and the game is not polished. <br>
-In the game, while not touching and dragging a card, time goes slow to give the player time to think about the next move and built an effective strategy. <br>
-The cards flying around is the mechanic for adding a new card to the deck. The player will also try to catch them while thinking about the next card to play.
-New enemies that are flying and new cards that have features like throwing projectiles, providing shield etc. will be added. <br>
-Note: The assets and sounds are obtained from the Unity Asset Store (https://assetstore.unity.com/), but the codes and the gameplay ideas belong to me.
